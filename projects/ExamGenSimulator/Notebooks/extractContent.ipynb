      "Scalable analytics can be complex, fragmented, and expensive. Microsoft Fabric simplifies analytics solutions by providing a single, easy-to-use product that integrates various tools and services into one platform. Fabric is a unified software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform where all data is stored in a single open format in OneLake. OneLake is accessible by all analytics engines in the platform, ensuring scalability, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection. OneLake OneLake is Fabric's centralized data storage architecture that enables collaboration by eliminating the need to move or copy data between systems. OneLake unifies your data across regions and clouds into a single logical lake without moving or duplicating data. OneLake is built on Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and supports various formats, including Delta, Parquet, CSV, and JSON. All compute engines in Fabric automatically store their data in OneLake, making it directly accessible without the need for movement or duplication. For tabular data, the analytical engines in Fabric write data in delta-parquet format and all engines interact with the format seamlessly. Shortcuts are references to files or storage locations external to OneLake, allowing you to access existing cloud data without copying it. Shortcuts ensure data consistency and enable Fabric to stay in sync with the source. Workspaces In Microsoft Fabric, workspaces serve as logical containers that help you organize and manage your data, reports, and other assets. They provide a clear separation of resources, making it easier to control access and maintain security. Each workspace has its own set of permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify its contents. This structure supports team collaboration while maintaining strict access control for both business and IT users. Workspaces allow you to manage compute resources and integrate with Git for version control. You can optimize performance and cost by configuring compute settings, while Git integration helps track changes, collaborate on code, and maintain a history of your work. Administration and governance Fabric's OneLake is centrally governed and open for collaboration. Data is secured and governed in one place, which allows users to easily find and access the data they need. Fabric administration is centralized in the Admin portal . In the admin portal you can manage groups and permissions, configure data sources and gateways, and monitor usage and performance. You can also access the Fabric admin APIs and SDKs in the admin portal, which can automate common tasks and integrate Fabric with other systems. The OneLake catalog helps you analyze, monitor, and maintain data governance. It provides guidance on sensitivity labels, item metadata, and data refresh status, offering insights into the governance status and actions for improvement. Note Review the Microsoft Fabric administration documentation for more information.\n"
